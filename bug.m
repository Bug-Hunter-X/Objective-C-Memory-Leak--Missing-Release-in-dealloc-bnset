This bug arises when dealing with Objective-C's memory management, specifically with properties declared using `retain` or `copy`.  If you forget to release objects assigned to these properties in `dealloc` or another appropriate method, you'll create a memory leak. The leaked memory accumulates over time and can lead to application crashes or instability.

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release]; // Missing release! Memory Leak!
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

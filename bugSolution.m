The solution addresses the memory leak by correctly releasing the retained property `myString` within the `dealloc` method.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release]; // Correct: Releases the retained string
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

**Important Note:** In modern Objective-C (using ARC - Automatic Reference Counting), this type of memory leak is largely avoided.  ARC automatically manages memory, eliminating the need for manual `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` calls. However, understanding this concept is crucial for working with legacy Objective-C code.

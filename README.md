# Objective-C Memory Leak Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Objective-C: memory leaks due to failure to release retained objects. The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code with a missing `release` call in the `dealloc` method.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected code. 

**Problem:** Failure to properly manage memory through `retain`/`release` cycles can lead to memory leaks and application instability. 

**Solution:** Ensure all retained objects are released in the appropriate method (typically `dealloc`) using the `release` method.
